A python template with CI/CD setup to automate my workflow for other assignments in the course. Feel free to use it!

This Python template provides a structured starting point for your Python projects. It includes the following components:

- Dockerfile for containerization
- .devcontainer.json for Visual Studio Code development containers
- Makefile for common project tasks
- requirements.txt for managing dependencies
- main.py for your project code
- test_main.py for testing your code

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python 3.x on your system.
3. (Optional) Install Docker for containerization.
4. (Optional) Install Visual Studio Code with the "Remote - Containers" extension.

## Usage

- Run your project's `main.py` script using Python.
- Test your code with the provided `test_main.py` script.
- Use the Makefile commands for common tasks, e.g., `make install-dependencies`, `make run`, `make test`.

- This also includes a docker container for running your scripts on a virtual envt.
