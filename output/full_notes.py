I have a project to work on for my fixed income (Bond trading desk)So i have a bunch of RFQs for a month the dataset has the following
* datetime
* CUSIP
* ISIN
* Security Name
* counterparty ID
* Direction (Buy or sell)I need to basically find out customer patterns on the data to see if i can unravel smth interesting that customers are trying to do? EditThis sounds like an interesting project analyzing bond trading patterns. To help uncover insights from your RFQ (Request for Quote) data, I can suggest a few approaches:

Time-based analysis:

Look for patterns in trading activity by time of day, day of week, or specific dates.
Identify any cyclical patterns or trends over the month.


Security-specific analysis:

Group RFQs by CUSIP/ISIN to see which securities are most frequently quoted.
Analyze if certain securities are predominantly bought or sold.


Counterparty behavior:

Examine RFQ patterns for specific counterparties.
Identify counterparties with unusual trading patterns or high volumes.


Buy/Sell imbalances:

Look for overall trends in buy vs. sell directions.
Analyze if certain securities or counterparties show strong directional bias.


Correlation analysis:

Check for correlations between RFQ activity and external market events or economic indicators.


Clustering analysis:

Use machine learning techniques to group similar RFQs and identify common characteristics.


Network analysis:

Map relationships between counterparties and securities to visualize trading patterns.



To get started, I'd recommend:

Clean and preprocess the data.
Perform basic statistical analysis on each variable.
Create visualizations to help identify patterns.
Apply more advanced analytical techniques based on initial findings.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or suggest specific analyses to perform on your dataset? CopyRetryFJim more interested in the network one and counter party specific stuffsome examples of customer patterns can be customer sends a feeler order (much lower volume) to get a sense of price, but then sends a big ordercustomer sends multiple orders in chunkscustomer sends similar orders idkHelp me find what else I can look at the data for? EditCertainly, focusing on network analysis and counterparty-specific patterns is a great approach. Here are some specific analyses and patterns you can look for in your data:

Network Analysis:

Create a network graph where nodes are counterparties and securities, with edges representing RFQs.
Analyze centrality measures to identify key players or securities in the network.
Look for clusters or cliques that might indicate coordinated trading behavior.


Counterparty-Specific Patterns:
a) Order Sequencing:

Identify instances of "feeler" orders followed by larger orders from the same counterparty.
Look for patterns in the time gap between these orders.

b) Order Chunking:

Detect sequences of orders for the same security from a single counterparty within a short time frame.
Analyze the total volume of these chunked orders compared to the counterparty's average order size.

c) Similar Order Patterns:

Use clustering algorithms to group similar orders based on security, volume, and timing.
Identify counterparties that frequently place similar orders across different securities.


Additional Patterns to Consider:
a) Time-of-Day Patterns:

Analyze if certain counterparties consistently trade at specific times of the day.

b) Correlated Trading:

Look for counterparties that tend to trade the same securities in close temporal proximity.

c) Directional Bias:

Identify counterparties with strong buy or sell biases for specific securities.

d) Volume Anomalies:

Detect sudden spikes in trading volume for specific counterparties or securities.

e) Pairs Trading:

Look for patterns where a counterparty consistently buys one security and sells another in close succession.

f) Seasonal Patterns:

Analyze if certain counterparties have recurring patterns at specific times of the month.

g) Price Sensitivity:

Examine how counterparties react to price changes in securities they frequently trade.

h) Cross-Security Behavior:

Identify counterparties that shift their trading focus between related securities.

i) Order Cancellation Patterns:

If you have data on cancelled RFQs, analyze patterns in order placement and cancellation.

j) Reaction to Market Events:

Study how different counterparties adjust their trading behavior following significant market events.



To implement these analyses, you might consider using tools like:

Network analysis libraries (e.g., NetworkX in Python)
Time series analysis techniques
Machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and anomaly detection
Visualization tools to represent complex relationships and patterns

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these specific patterns or suggest ways to implement these analyses in your dataset? CopyRetryFJhelp me code this out pls? also can u create like a streamlit dashboard for this? EditCertainly! I'd be happy to help you code this analysis and create a Streamlit dashboard. We'll break this down into steps:

Data preprocessing
Analysis functions
Streamlit dashboard creation

Let's start with a basic structure and then we can expand on it. I'll use Python with pandas for data manipulation, NetworkX for network analysis, and Streamlit for the dashboard.
First, let's set up the environment:
bashCopypip install pandas numpy networkx streamlit plotly
Now, let's create a Python script. We'll call it bond_trading_analysis.py:
pythonCopyimport pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import streamlit as st
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from datetime import timedelta

# Load the data
@st.cache_data
def load_data():
    # Replace 'your_data.csv' with your actual data file
    df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
    df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['datetime'])
    return df

# Feeler Order Analysis
def detect_feeler_orders(df, volume_threshold=0.5, time_threshold=timedelta(hours=1)):
    df = df.sort_values(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP', 'datetime'])
    df['next_order_time'] = df.groupby(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP'])['datetime'].shift(-1)
    df['time_diff'] = df['next_order_time'] - df['datetime']
    df['next_order_volume'] = df.groupby(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP'])['volume'].shift(-1)
    
    feeler_orders = df[
        (df['volume'] < df['next_order_volume'] * volume_threshold) &
        (df['time_diff'] <= time_threshold)
    ]
    
    return feeler_orders

# Order Chunking Analysis
def detect_chunked_orders(df, time_threshold=timedelta(minutes=30)):
    df = df.sort_values(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP', 'datetime'])
    df['time_diff'] = df.groupby(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP'])['datetime'].diff()
    
    chunked_orders = df[df['time_diff'] <= time_threshold].groupby(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP']).filter(lambda x: len(x) > 1)
    
    return chunked_orders

# Network Analysis
def create_network(df):
    G = nx.Graph()
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        G.add_edge(row['counterparty_ID'], row['CUSIP'], weight=1)
    
    return G

# Streamlit Dashboard
def main():
    st.title('Bond Trading Analysis Dashboard')

    df = load_data()

    st.header('Data Overview')
    st.write(df.head())

    st.header('Feeler Order Analysis')
    volume_threshold = st.slider('Volume Threshold', 0.1, 1.0, 0.5)
    time_threshold = st.slider('Time Threshold (hours)', 1, 24, 1)
    feeler_orders = detect_feeler_orders(df, volume_threshold, timedelta(hours=time_threshold))
    st.write(feeler_orders)

    st.header('Order Chunking Analysis')
    chunk_time_threshold = st.slider('Chunk Time Threshold (minutes)', 5, 120, 30)
    chunked_orders = detect_chunked_orders(df, timedelta(minutes=chunk_time_threshold))
    st.write(chunked_orders)

    st.header('Network Analysis')
    G = create_network(df)
    fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Sankey(

      ))])

    fig.update_layout(title_text="Counterparty-Security Network", font_size=10)
    st.plotly_chart(fig)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
To run this Streamlit app, save the script and then run:
bashCopystreamlit run bond_trading_analysis.py
This script creates a basic Streamlit dashboard with the following features:

Data overview
Feeler order analysis with adjustable parameters
Order chunking analysis with adjustable parameters
Network visualization of counterparties and securities

To expand on this, you could add more analyses and visualizations:

Time-of-day patterns: Add a heatmap showing trading activity by hour and day of week.
Directional bias: Create a bar chart showing buy vs. sell ratios for each counterparty.
Volume anomalies: Implement a simple anomaly detection algorithm and display unusual volume spikes.
Pairs trading: Identify and display potential pairs trading patterns.

Remember to replace 'your_data.csv' with the actual path to your data file. Also, you might need to adjust the column names in the code to match your dataset.
This is a starting point. You can expand on this dashboard by adding more analyses and visualizations based on the patterns we discussed earlier. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part or add any particular analysis to this dashboard? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJwhat do u mean by pairs trading? EditCertainly, I'd be happy to explain pairs trading in more detail.
Pairs trading is a trading strategy that involves identifying two securities whose prices have historically moved together, or are expected to move together due to similar characteristics or market forces. Traders then take advantage of temporary divergences in the price relationship between these two securities.
In the context of bond trading, pairs trading might involve:

Finding two bonds with similar characteristics (e.g., maturity, credit rating, sector) that typically move in tandem.
Monitoring the spread or ratio between the prices (or yields) of these two bonds.
When the spread deviates significantly from its historical norm, a trader might:

Buy the relatively undervalued bond
Sell (or short) the relatively overvalued bond


The expectation is that the spread will eventually revert to its normal level, allowing the trader to profit from both positions.

For your RFQ data, you could look for patterns that might indicate pairs trading behavior:

Identify counterparties that frequently request quotes for certain pairs of bonds within a short time frame.
Look for consistent patterns where a counterparty buys one bond and sells another related bond.
Analyze if these paired trades occur when there's a significant change in the spread between the two bonds.

To implement this in your analysis, you could add a function like this:
pythonCopydef detect_potential_pairs_trading(df, time_threshold=timedelta(minutes=30)):
    # Sort the dataframe
    df = df.sort_values(['counterparty_ID', 'datetime'])
    
    # Create a window for each counterparty
    df['time_diff'] = df.groupby('counterparty_ID')['datetime'].diff()
    
    # Identify potential pairs
    potential_pairs = df[df['time_diff'] <= time_threshold].groupby('counterparty_ID').filter(lambda x: len(x) > 1)
    
    # Group the potential pairs
    paired_trades = potential_pairs.groupby(['counterparty_ID', 'datetime']).agg({
        'CUSIP': list,
        'Direction': list
    }).reset_index()
    
    # Filter for opposite directions (buy and sell)
    paired_trades = paired_trades[paired_trades['Direction'].apply(lambda x: 'Buy' in x and 'Sell' in x)]
    
    return paired_trades

# In your Streamlit app:
st.header('Potential Pairs Trading')
pairs_time_threshold = st.slider('Pairs Time Threshold (minutes)', 5, 120, 30)
potential_pairs = detect_potential_pairs_trading(df, timedelta(minutes=pairs_time_threshold))
st.write(potential_pairs)
This function looks for instances where a counterparty has requested quotes for two different securities within a short time frame, with one being a buy and the other a sell. These could potentially indicate pairs trading behavior.
Remember that this is a simplified approach and may need refinement based on the specifics of your data and the bond market you're analyzing. Pairs trading in the bond market can be quite complex, involving factors like duration matching, credit spread analysis, and more.
Would you like me to explain any other aspects of pairs trading or how to further refine this analysis for your specific use case? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJwhat other patterns do u think i can look for? EditCertainly! There are several other patterns you could look for in your bond trading RFQ data. Here are some additional ideas:

Ladder Trading:

Look for patterns where a counterparty requests quotes for a series of bonds with staggered maturities.
This could indicate attempts to build or adjust a bond ladder.


Sector Rotation:

Analyze if counterparties are shifting their focus from one sector to another over time.
This could indicate changing views on different parts of the economy.


Credit Rating Shifts:

Look for patterns where counterparties are moving from higher-rated to lower-rated bonds (or vice versa).
This could indicate changing risk appetites or views on credit markets.


Yield Curve Positioning:

Analyze if counterparties are focusing on specific parts of the yield curve (short-term, intermediate, long-term).
Look for shifts in this focus over time.


Arbitrage Opportunities:

Identify instances where a counterparty quickly buys and sells the same bond.
This could indicate attempts to profit from price discrepancies.


Event-Driven Trading:

Correlate spikes in RFQ activity for specific bonds with significant news events or economic data releases.


Spread Trading:

Look for patterns of simultaneous RFQs for Treasury bonds and corporate bonds.
This could indicate attempts to trade on credit spreads.


Roll Trading:

Identify patterns where counterparties sell bonds nearing maturity and buy similar bonds with longer maturities.


Contrarian Behavior:

Look for counterparties that consistently trade against the general trend.


Liquidity Seeking:

Identify counterparties that frequently request quotes for the most liquid bonds.


New Issue Focus:

Analyze if certain counterparties consistently show interest in newly issued bonds.


Seasonal Patterns:

Look for recurring patterns tied to specific times of the year (e.g., fiscal year-end, tax seasons).


Market-Making Behavior:

Identify counterparties that frequently request both buy and sell quotes for the same bonds.


Correlated Security Trading:

Look for patterns where RFQs for certain bonds are correlated with RFQs for related securities (e.g., stocks of the same company).


Volume-Price Sensitivity:

Analyze how the volume of RFQs changes with price movements in specific bonds.



To implement these analyses, you'd typically need to:

Enrich your dataset with additional information (e.g., bond sectors, credit ratings, maturities).
Create time-based features to capture temporal aspects.
Implement pattern recognition algorithms or use machine learning techniques for more complex patterns.

Here's a simple example of how you might implement one of these (Ladder Trading) in your analysis:
pythonCopydef detect_ladder_trading(df, time_threshold=timedelta(hours=24)):
    # Assuming you have a 'maturity' column in your dataframe
    df = df.sort_values(['counterparty_ID', 'datetime'])
    df['time_diff'] = df.groupby('counterparty_ID')['datetime'].diff()
    
    potential_ladders = df[df['time_diff'] <= time_threshold].groupby('counterparty_ID').filter(lambda x: len(x) >= 3)
    
    ladders = potential_ladders.groupby('counterparty_ID').apply(
        lambda x: x.sort_values('maturity')['maturity'].diff().mean() > 0
    ).reset_index(name='is_ladder')
    
    return ladders[ladders['is_ladder']]

# In your Streamlit app:
st.header('Potential Ladder Trading')
ladder_time_threshold = st.slider('Ladder Time Threshold (hours)', 1, 48, 24)
potential_ladders = detect_ladder_trading(df, timedelta(hours=ladder_time_threshold))
st.write(potential_ladders)
This function looks for instances where a counterparty has requested quotes for at least three bonds within a specified time frame, with increasing maturities.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these patterns or provide code examples for implementing them in your analysis? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJmore pls more EditAbsolutely! Let's dive into a few more complex patterns and how to implement them. I'll provide code examples for each, which you can integrate into your Streamlit dashboard.

Sector Rotation Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_sector_rotation(df, window_size='30D'):
    # Assuming you have a 'sector' column in your dataframe
    sector_activity = df.set_index('datetime').groupby('sector').resample(window_size).size().unstack(level=0).fillna(0)
    sector_pct = sector_activity.div(sector_activity.sum(axis=1), axis=0)
    
    # Calculate the change in sector focus
    sector_change = sector_pct.diff()
    
    return sector_change

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Sector Rotation Analysis')
window_size = st.selectbox('Window Size', ['7D', '30D', '90D'], index=1)
sector_rotation = analyze_sector_rotation(df, window_size)
st.line_chart(sector_rotation)
This function analyzes how the focus on different sectors changes over time, which could indicate sector rotation strategies.

Credit Rating Shift Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_credit_rating_shifts(df, window_size='30D'):
    # Assuming you have a 'credit_rating' column in your dataframe
    rating_activity = df.set_index('datetime').groupby('credit_rating').resample(window_size).size().unstack(level=0).fillna(0)
    rating_pct = rating_activity.div(rating_activity.sum(axis=1), axis=0)
    
    # Calculate the change in credit rating focus
    rating_change = rating_pct.diff()
    
    return rating_change

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Credit Rating Shift Analysis')
window_size = st.selectbox('Window Size', ['7D', '30D', '90D'], index=1)
rating_shifts = analyze_credit_rating_shifts(df, window_size)
st.line_chart(rating_shifts)
This function looks at how the focus on different credit ratings changes over time, potentially indicating shifts in risk appetite.

Yield Curve Positioning:

pythonCopydef analyze_yield_curve_positioning(df, short_threshold=2, long_threshold=10):
    df['maturity_category'] = pd.cut(df['years_to_maturity'], 
                                     bins=[-float('inf'), short_threshold, long_threshold, float('inf')],
                                     labels=['Short', 'Intermediate', 'Long'])
    
    positioning = df.groupby(['datetime', 'maturity_category']).size().unstack(fill_value=0)
    positioning_pct = positioning.div(positioning.sum(axis=1), axis=0)
    
    return positioning_pct

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Yield Curve Positioning')
short_threshold = st.slider('Short-term Threshold (years)', 1, 5, 2)
long_threshold = st.slider('Long-term Threshold (years)', 5, 20, 10)
positioning = analyze_yield_curve_positioning(df, short_threshold, long_threshold)
st.area_chart(positioning)
This function categorizes bonds into short, intermediate, and long-term based on their maturity, and shows how the focus on each category changes over time.

Event-Driven Trading Analysis:

pythonCopyimport yfinance as yf

def analyze_event_driven_trading(df, market_indicator='^TNX'):
    # Download market data (e.g., 10-year Treasury yield)
    market_data = yf.download(market_indicator, start=df['datetime'].min(), end=df['datetime'].max())
    
    # Resample RFQ data to daily frequency
    daily_activity = df.set_index('datetime').resample('D').size()
    
    # Combine RFQ activity with market data
    combined_data = pd.concat([daily_activity, market_data['Close']], axis=1).dropna()
    combined_data.columns = ['RFQ_Count', 'Market_Indicator']
    
    # Calculate daily changes
    combined_data['RFQ_Change'] = combined_data['RFQ_Count'].pct_change()
    combined_data['Market_Change'] = combined_data['Market_Indicator'].pct_change()
    
    # Identify significant events (e.g., large market moves)
    threshold = combined_data['Market_Change'].std() * 2
    combined_data['Significant_Event'] = abs(combined_data['Market_Change']) > threshold
    
    return combined_data

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Event-Driven Trading Analysis')
event_analysis = analyze_event_driven_trading(df)
fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=event_analysis.index, y=event_analysis['RFQ_Change'], name='RFQ Activity Change'))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=event_analysis.index, y=event_analysis['Market_Change'], name='Market Indicator Change'))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=event_analysis[event_analysis['Significant_Event']].index, 
                         y=event_analysis[event_analysis['Significant_Event']]['Market_Change'],
                         mode='markers', name='Significant Events', marker=dict(size=10, color='red')))
st.plotly_chart(fig)
This function attempts to correlate RFQ activity with significant market events, using the 10-year Treasury yield as a market indicator.

Contrarian Behavior Analysis:

pythonCopydef identify_contrarian_behavior(df, window_size='7D'):
    # Calculate overall market direction
    market_direction = df.set_index('datetime').resample(window_size)['Direction'].apply(
        lambda x: 1 if x.value_counts().idxmax() == 'Buy' else -1
    )
    
    # Calculate each counterparty's direction
    counterparty_direction = df.set_index('datetime').groupby('counterparty_ID').resample(window_size)['Direction'].apply(
        lambda x: 1 if x.value_counts().idxmax() == 'Buy' else -1
    ).unstack(level=0)
    
    # Identify contrarian behavior
    contrarian = (counterparty_direction != market_direction).sum()
    contrarian_pct = contrarian / len(market_direction)
    
    return contrarian_pct.sort_values(ascending=False)

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Contrarian Behavior Analysis')
window_size = st.selectbox('Window Size', ['1D', '7D', '30D'], index=1)
contrarian_behavior = identify_contrarian_behavior(df, window_size)
st.bar_chart(contrarian_behavior)
This function identifies counterparties that frequently trade against the general market direction, potentially indicating contrarian strategies.
These are more advanced analyses that can provide deeper insights into trading patterns. Remember to handle any missing data and ensure your dataset has the necessary columns (like 'sector', 'credit_rating', 'years_to_maturity', etc.) for these functions to work properly.
Would you like me to explain any of these in more detail or provide additional patterns to analyze? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJi also have another dataset which has portfolio tradeslike when a counterparty tries to send a quote for a portfolio of bonds together rather than one EditThat's excellent information! Portfolio trades are indeed a significant aspect of bond trading, especially for institutional investors. Analyzing portfolio trades alongside individual RFQs can provide deeper insights into trading strategies and market dynamics. Let's explore how we can incorporate this data into our analysis.
First, let's outline some key aspects we can analyze with portfolio trade data:

Portfolio Composition Analysis
Frequency and Timing of Portfolio Trades
Comparison of Portfolio Trades vs. Individual RFQs
Sector Allocation in Portfolios
Duration and Risk Profile of Portfolios
Pricing Efficiency of Portfolio Trades

Now, let's implement some of these analyses:
pythonCopyimport pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import streamlit as st

# Assume we have two dataframes: 
# df_rfq for individual RFQs
# df_portfolio for portfolio trades

    df_portfolio['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df_portfolio['datetime'])
    return df_portfolio

# 1. Portfolio Composition Analysis
def analyze_portfolio_composition(df_portfolio):
    # Assuming each row in df_portfolio represents a bond in a portfolio trade
    portfolio_sizes = df_portfolio.groupby('portfolio_id').size()
    avg_portfolio_size = portfolio_sizes.mean()
    max_portfolio_size = portfolio_sizes.max()
    min_portfolio_size = portfolio_sizes.min()
    
    return {
        'average_size': avg_portfolio_size,
        'max_size': max_portfolio_size,
        'min_size': min_portfolio_size,
        'size_distribution': portfolio_sizes.value_counts().sort_index()
    }

# 2. Frequency and Timing of Portfolio Trades
def analyze_portfolio_timing(df_portfolio):
    daily_counts = df_portfolio['portfolio_id'].resample('D').nunique()
    hourly_counts = df_portfolio['portfolio_id'].resample('H').nunique()
    
    return daily_counts, hourly_counts

def compare_portfolio_vs_individual(df_rfq, df_portfolio):
    df_rfq['trade_type'] = 'Individual'
    df_portfolio['trade_type'] = 'Portfolio'
    
    combined = pd.concat([
        df_rfq[['datetime', 'trade_type']],
        df_portfolio[['datetime', 'trade_type']]
    ])
    
    daily_comparison = combined.set_index('datetime').resample('D').value_counts(normalize=True).unstack()
    
    return daily_comparison

# 4. Sector Allocation in Portfolios
def analyze_sector_allocation(df_portfolio):
    sector_allocation = df_portfolio.groupby('portfolio_id')['sector'].value_counts(normalize=True).unstack()
    avg_sector_allocation = sector_allocation.mean()
    
    return avg_sector_allocation

# 5. Duration and Risk Profile of Portfolios
def analyze_portfolio_risk(df_portfolio):
    # Assuming we have 'duration' and 'credit_rating' columns
    portfolio_duration = df_portfolio.groupby('portfolio_id')['duration'].mean()
    portfolio_credit = df_portfolio.groupby('portfolio_id')['credit_rating'].apply(lambda x: x.mode().iloc[0])
    
    return portfolio_duration, portfolio_credit

This script adds several new analyses specifically for portfolio trades:

It analyzes the composition of portfolios, showing the distribution of portfolio sizes.
It examines the frequency and timing of portfolio trades, both daily and hourly.
It compares the prevalence of portfolio trades vs. individual RFQs over time.
It shows the average sector allocation within portfolios.
It visualizes the risk profile of portfolios, plotting duration against credit rating.

To further enhance this analysis, you could:

Analyze the pricing efficiency of portfolio trades compared to individual RFQs.
Look for patterns in which counterparties tend to use portfolio trades more frequently.
Examine if certain market conditions correlate with increased portfolio trading activity.
Analyze the performance of portfolio trades over time (if you have post-trade data).
Investigate if there are common combinations of bonds that appear frequently in portfolio trades.

Remember to adjust the code according to your actual data structure and column names. This script assumes certain columns exist in your dataset, so you may need to modify it based on your specific data.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these analyses or suggest more ways to integrate the portfolio trade data with your individual RFQ analysis? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJcan u identify any other RFQ trends which help us see repeated inquiries etc EditCertainly! Identifying repeated inquiries and other RFQ trends can provide valuable insights into trading patterns and customer behavior. Let's explore some additional analyses to uncover these trends:

Repeated Inquiries Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_repeated_inquiries(df, time_window='1D'):
    df_sorted = df.sort_values(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP', 'datetime'])
    df_sorted['prev_inquiry_time'] = df_sorted.groupby(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP'])['datetime'].shift(1)
    df_sorted['time_since_last_inquiry'] = df_sorted['datetime'] - df_sorted['prev_inquiry_time']
    
    repeated_inquiries = df_sorted[df_sorted['time_since_last_inquiry'] <= pd.Timedelta(time_window)]
    
    return repeated_inquiries

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Repeated Inquiries Analysis')
time_window = st.selectbox('Time Window for Repeated Inquiries', ['1H', '6H', '1D', '7D'], index=2)
repeated_inquiries = analyze_repeated_inquiries(df, time_window)
st.write(f"Number of repeated inquiries within {time_window}: {len(repeated_inquiries)}")
st.write(repeated_inquiries)
This function identifies cases where a counterparty inquires about the same bond within a specified time window.

Inquiry Frequency Heatmap:

pythonCopyimport plotly.express as px

def create_inquiry_heatmap(df):
    df['hour'] = df['datetime'].dt.hour
    df['day_of_week'] = df['datetime'].dt.dayofweek
    heatmap_data = df.groupby(['day_of_week', 'hour']).size().unstack()
    
    fig = px.imshow(heatmap_data, 
                    labels=dict(x="Hour of Day", y="Day of Week", color="Number of Inquiries"),
                    x=heatmap_data.columns, 
                    y=['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'])
    return fig

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Inquiry Frequency Heatmap')
heatmap_fig = create_inquiry_heatmap(df)
st.plotly_chart(heatmap_fig)
This creates a heatmap showing the frequency of inquiries by day of week and hour of day.

Inquiry Persistence Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_inquiry_persistence(df, max_attempts=5):
    df_sorted = df.sort_values(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP', 'datetime'])
    df_sorted['inquiry_number'] = df_sorted.groupby(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP']).cumcount() + 1
    
    persistence_counts = df_sorted.groupby('CUSIP')['inquiry_number'].max().value_counts().sort_index()
    
    return persistence_counts

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Inquiry Persistence Analysis')
persistence_counts = analyze_inquiry_persistence(df)
st.bar_chart(persistence_counts)
st.write("This chart shows how many times bonds are inquired about before the inquiries stop.")
This analysis shows how persistent counterparties are in inquiring about specific bonds.

Time Between Inquiries Distribution:

pythonCopydef analyze_time_between_inquiries(df):
    df_sorted = df.sort_values(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP', 'datetime'])
    df_sorted['time_since_last_inquiry'] = df_sorted.groupby(['counterparty_ID', 'CUSIP'])['datetime'].diff()
    
    time_distribution = df_sorted['time_since_last_inquiry'].dropna()
    
    fig = px.histogram(time_distribution, nbins=50, 
                       labels={'value': 'Time Since Last Inquiry', 'count': 'Frequency'},
                       title='Distribution of Time Between Inquiries')
    return fig

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Time Between Inquiries Distribution')
time_dist_fig = analyze_time_between_inquiries(df)
st.plotly_chart(time_dist_fig)
This shows the distribution of time intervals between inquiries for the same bond by the same counterparty.

Inquiry Seasonality Analysis:

pythonCopyfrom statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

def analyze_inquiry_seasonality(df, freq='W'):
    daily_counts = df.set_index('datetime').resample('D').size()
    result = seasonal_decompose(daily_counts, model='additive', period=7)
    
    fig = go.Figure()
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=result.trend.index, y=result.trend, mode='lines', name='Trend'))
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=result.seasonal.index, y=result.seasonal, mode='lines', name='Seasonal'))
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=result.resid.index, y=result.resid, mode='lines', name='Residual'))
    fig.update_layout(title='Inquiry Seasonality Decomposition', xaxis_title='Date', yaxis_title='Number of Inquiries')
    
    return fig

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Inquiry Seasonality Analysis')
seasonality_fig = analyze_inquiry_seasonality(df)
st.plotly_chart(seasonality_fig)
This decomposes the time series of inquiries to show trend, seasonality, and residual components.

Inquiry Clustering Analysis:

pythonCopyfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def analyze_inquiry_clusters(df, n_clusters=5):
    # Extract features for clustering
    df['hour'] = df['datetime'].dt.hour
    df['day_of_week'] = df['datetime'].dt.dayofweek
    
    features = df[['hour', 'day_of_week']].values
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)
    
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)
    df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(features_scaled)
    
    fig = px.scatter(df, x='hour', y='day_of_week', color='cluster', 
                     labels={'hour': 'Hour of Day', 'day_of_week': 'Day of Week'},
                     title='Inquiry Clusters')
    return fig

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Inquiry Clustering Analysis')
n_clusters = st.slider('Number of Clusters', 2, 10, 5)
cluster_fig = analyze_inquiry_clusters(df, n_clusters)
st.plotly_chart(cluster_fig)
This clusters inquiries based on their timing, which can reveal patterns in when different types of inquiries occur.
These analyses will help you identify various patterns in repeated inquiries and other RFQ trends. You can integrate these into your Streamlit dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of inquiry behavior.
Would you like me to explain any of these analyses further or suggest ways to dive deeper into specific aspects of RFQ trends? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJother stuff too pls i basically need to identify concrete patterns which can help my desk identify potential pricing opportunities. we are a market maker EditAbsolutely! As a market maker, identifying concrete patterns that can lead to pricing opportunities is crucial. Let's explore some additional analyses that could be particularly valuable for your desk:

Spread Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_bid_ask_spreads(df):
    df['spread'] = df['ask_price'] - df['bid_price']
    df['spread_percentage'] = df['spread'] / df['mid_price'] * 100
    
    # Analyze spreads by bond characteristics
    spread_by_rating = df.groupby('credit_rating')['spread_percentage'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
    spread_by_sector = df.groupby('sector')['spread_percentage'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
    
    # Analyze how spreads change with volume
    df['volume_bucket'] = pd.qcut(df['volume'], q=5)
    spread_by_volume = df.groupby('volume_bucket')['spread_percentage'].mean()
    
    return spread_by_rating, spread_by_sector, spread_by_volume

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Spread Analysis')
spread_by_rating, spread_by_sector, spread_by_volume = analyze_bid_ask_spreads(df)
st.subheader('Average Spread by Credit Rating')
st.bar_chart(spread_by_rating)
st.subheader('Average Spread by Sector')
st.bar_chart(spread_by_sector)
st.subheader('Average Spread by Volume')
st.line_chart(spread_by_volume)
This analysis helps identify where you might have opportunities to widen spreads or where you need to tighten them to remain competitive.

Price Improvement Opportunities:

pythonCopydef identify_price_improvement_opportunities(df, threshold=0.1):
    df['price_diff'] = df.groupby('CUSIP')['mid_price'].diff()
    df['price_diff_pct'] = df['price_diff'] / df['mid_price'].shift(1) * 100
    
    opportunities = df[abs(df['price_diff_pct']) > threshold].sort_values('datetime')
    return opportunities

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Price Improvement Opportunities')
threshold = st.slider('Price Change Threshold (%)', 0.1, 1.0, 0.5)
opportunities = identify_price_improvement_opportunities(df, threshold)
st.write(opportunities)
This identifies bonds with significant price movements, which could represent opportunities for price improvement or arbitrage.

Liquidity Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_liquidity(df):
    liquidity_score = df.groupby('CUSIP').agg({
        'volume': 'sum',
        'datetime': 'count',
        'spread_percentage': 'mean'
    })
    liquidity_score['score'] = (liquidity_score['volume'] * liquidity_score['datetime']) / liquidity_score['spread_percentage']
    return liquidity_score.sort_values('score', ascending=False)

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Liquidity Analysis')
liquidity_scores = analyze_liquidity(df)
st.write(liquidity_scores)
This creates a liquidity score for each bond, helping you identify which bonds might be easier to trade or where you might need to adjust your pricing strategy.

Order Flow Imbalance:

pythonCopydef analyze_order_flow_imbalance(df, window='1D'):
    df['direction'] = np.where(df['Direction'] == 'Buy', 1, -1)
    flow_imbalance = df.set_index('datetime').groupby('CUSIP')['direction'].rolling(window).sum()
    return flow_imbalance.unstack(level=0).fillna(0)

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Order Flow Imbalance')
window = st.selectbox('Time Window', ['1H', '4H', '1D', '7D'], index=2)
flow_imbalance = analyze_order_flow_imbalance(df, window)
st.line_chart(flow_imbalance)
This analysis helps identify bonds with persistent buying or selling pressure, which could inform your pricing and inventory management strategies.

This analysis shows which bonds are most correlated with a benchmark (like Treasury yields), helping you identify potential hedging opportunities or relative value trades.

Volatility Clustering:

pythonCopydef analyze_volatility_clustering(df):
    daily_returns = df.groupby(['datetime', 'CUSIP'])['mid_price'].last().unstack().pct_change()
    volatility = daily_returns.rolling(window=30).std() * np.sqrt(252)  # Annualized volatility
    
    high_vol_bonds = volatility.iloc[-1].sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
    return high_vol_bonds

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Volatility Clustering')
high_vol_bonds = analyze_volatility_clustering(df)
st.bar_chart(high_vol_bonds)
st.write("These bonds have shown the highest volatility recently and may present trading opportunities.")
This identifies bonds with high recent volatility, which could present opportunities for wider spreads or more active trading.

RFQ Response Time Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_rfq_response_time(df):
    df['response_time'] = df['response_datetime'] - df['datetime']
    avg_response_time = df.groupby('CUSIP')['response_time'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
    return avg_response_time

# In Streamlit:
st.header('RFQ Response Time Analysis')
response_times = analyze_rfq_response_time(df)
st.bar_chart(response_times)
st.write("Bonds with longer average response times may indicate pricing uncertainty or complexity.")
This analysis can help you identify which bonds are taking longer to price, potentially indicating areas where you need to improve your pricing models or where there might be less competition.
These analyses provide concrete patterns and insights that can help your market-making desk identify potential pricing opportunities, manage risk, and optimize your trading strategies. Remember to adapt these functions to your specific data structure and add any additional business logic or thresholds that are relevant to your trading desk.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these analyses or suggest ways to combine them for more comprehensive insights? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJi dont have pricing data unfortunately :( EditI apologize for the confusion. Thank you for clarifying that you don't have pricing data. That's an important detail. Let's refocus on analyses we can perform without pricing information, using only the RFQ data you have available. Here are some valuable analyses that don't require pricing data:

RFQ Frequency Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_rfq_frequency(df):
    daily_rfq_count = df.set_index('datetime').resample('D').size()
    hourly_rfq_count = df.set_index('datetime').resample('H').size()
    
    return daily_rfq_count, hourly_rfq_count

# In Streamlit:
st.header('RFQ Frequency Analysis')
daily_rfq, hourly_rfq = analyze_rfq_frequency(df)
st.subheader('Daily RFQ Count')
st.line_chart(daily_rfq)
st.subheader('Average Hourly RFQ Count')
st.bar_chart(hourly_rfq.groupby(hourly_rfq.index.hour).mean())
This analysis helps identify peak times for RFQs, which can inform staffing and resource allocation.

Bond Popularity Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_bond_popularity(df):
    bond_popularity = df['CUSIP'].value_counts()
    return bond_popularity.head(20)

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Most Frequently Requested Bonds')
popular_bonds = analyze_bond_popularity(df)
st.bar_chart(popular_bonds)
This shows which bonds are most frequently requested, helping you focus on the most active securities.

Counterparty Activity Analysis:

size_dist_fig = analyze_rfq_size_distribution(df)
st.plotly_chart(size_dist_fig)
This shows the distribution of RFQ sizes, helping you understand the typical trade sizes you're dealing with.

Direction Imbalance Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_direction_imbalance(df, window='1D'):
    df['direction'] = np.where(df['Direction'] == 'Buy', 1, -1)
    imbalance = df.set_index('datetime').groupby('CUSIP')['direction'].rolling(window).sum()
    return imbalance.unstack(level=0).fillna(0)

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Buy/Sell Imbalance')
window = st.selectbox('Time Window', ['1H', '4H', '1D', '7D'], index=2)
imbalance = analyze_direction_imbalance(df, window)
st.line_chart(imbalance)
This shows which bonds have persistent buying or selling pressure over time.

RFQ Clustering Analysis:

pythonCopyfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def analyze_rfq_clusters(df, n_clusters=5):
    features = df[['volume', 'years_to_maturity']].values
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)
    
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)
    df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(features_scaled)
    
    fig = px.scatter(df, x='volume', y='years_to_maturity', color='cluster', 
                     labels={'volume': 'RFQ Volume', 'years_to_maturity': 'Years to Maturity'},
                     title='RFQ Clusters')
    return fig

# In Streamlit:
st.header('RFQ Clustering Analysis')

cluster_fig = analyze_rfq_clusters(df, n_clusters)
st.plotly_chart(cluster_fig)
This clusters RFQs based on volume and maturity, potentially revealing different types of trading behavior.

Sector Rotation Analysis:

pythonCopydef analyze_sector_rotation(df, window_size='30D'):
    sector_activity = df.set_index('datetime').groupby('sector').resample(window_size).size().unstack(level=0).fillna(0)
    sector_pct = sector_activity.div(sector_activity.sum(axis=1), axis=0)
    
    sector_change = sector_pct.diff()
    
    return sector_change

# In Streamlit:
st.header('Sector Rotation Analysis')
window_size = st.selectbox('Window Size', ['7D', '30D', '90D'], index=1)
sector_rotation = analyze_sector_rotation(df, window_size)
st.line_chart(sector_rotation)
This shows how interest in different sectors changes over time.

RFQ Response Time Analysis (if you have this data):

pythonCopydef analyze_rfq_response_time(df):
    df['response_time'] = (df['response_datetime'] - df['datetime']).dt.total_seconds()
    avg_response_time = df.groupby('CUSIP')['response_time'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
    return avg_response_time

# In Streamlit:
st.header('RFQ Response Time Analysis')
response_times = analyze_rfq_response_time(df)
st.bar_chart(response_times)
st.write("Bonds with longer average response times may indicate pricing uncertainty or complexity.")
This can help identify which bonds are taking longer to price or respond to.
These analyses focus on the patterns and trends in RFQ activity, which can still provide valuable insights for your market-making desk. They can help you understand customer behavior, identify popular bonds, recognize market trends, and optimize your operations.
Remember to adjust these functions based on the specific columns and data you have available. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these analyses or suggest ways to derive more insights from your RFQ data? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJthis is a snapshot of my dataThank you for sharing the snapshot of your data. This gives me a clearer picture of the information you're working with. Based on this sample, I can see that you have quite detailed RFQ (Request for Quote) data for bond trading. Let's break down what we can analyze with this data:

Time-based analysis:

You have precise datetime stamps, allowing for time-series analysis.


Security identification:

'sym' and 'isin' columns provide security identifiers.


RFQ characteristics:

'rfqCustTierInfo' seems to indicate customer tiers.
'normalizedState' shows the state of the RFQ (e.g., DEALER_TIMED_OUT, CLIENT_TIMED_OUT).
'liquiditySore' might be a measure of liquidity.


Volume information:

'rfqL0DealQty' appears to be the deal quantity.


Deal value:

'rfqL0DealValueTypeStr' contains deal value information.


Direction:

'rfqL0VerbStrid' indicates BUY or SELL direction.


Market and counterparty:

'rfqMarketId' shows the market (e.g., Market Axess).
'rfqCounterparty' provides counterparty identifiers.



Given this data, here are some analyses you could perform:

RFQ Frequency Analysis:
Analyze the frequency of RFQs over time (hourly, daily, weekly patterns).
Security Popularity:
Identify which securities (by 'sym' or 'isin') are most frequently queried.
Customer Tier Analysis:
Examine how RFQ patterns differ across customer tiers.
State Analysis:
Investigate the frequency of different RFQ states (e.g., completed deals vs. timeouts).
Volume Analysis:
Analyze the distribution of deal quantities.
Buy vs. Sell Imbalance:
Look at the ratio of buy to sell requests over time or by security.
Counterparty Activity:
Identify most active counterparties and their trading patterns.
Liquidity Score Analysis:
If 'liquidityScore' is indeed a measure of liquidity, analyze how it correlates with other factors.
Market Analysis:
Compare RFQ patterns across different markets (if there are multiple in 'rfqMarketId').
Deal Value Type Analysis:
Examine the distribution and patterns of different deal value types.

Would you like me to provide code snippets or more detailed explanations for any of these analyses based on your specific data structure? CopyRetryFJyeah so given this, can u help me make a streamlit dashboard doing the following:Do all the basic analysis u mentioned firstThen basically add 2 sliders which do the followiing and are dynamic (user can choose the values)time difference (to make it flexible, can be one day, 1 hr, 1 week whatever)number of daysthis will help in clustering and show that these many counterparties fall within these filters, and then add a tab which has details on those counter parties, like what trades they did and of how much volumethen within the counterparty details, add filter for size of trade (only include same or like within a range?)
securities (exact same, same company but diff tenor?) smth like thatadd other features toomake the dashboard as flexible and as interactive as possibledivide it into several tabs (using streamlit tabs feature) for better analysisgraphs should be visually appealing EditCertainly!

# Add more tabs or analyses as needed
This script creates a Streamlit dashboard with four main tabs:

Basic Analysis: Shows overall RFQ frequency, popular securities, customer tier distribution, and buy vs. sell distribution.
Time-based Filtering: Allows users to filter data based on time difference and number of days, showing counterparties with repeated RFQs within the specified timeframe.
Counterparty Analysis: Displays most active counterparties and allows filtering based on deal quantity and selected securities.
Security Analysis: Provides insights into security volumes, RFQ states by security, and a time series analysis for selected securities.

To run this dashboard:

Save the script as bond_trading_dashboard.py
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (streamlit, pandas, plotly)
Replace 'your_data.csv' with the path to your actual data file
Run the command: streamlit run bond_trading_dashboard.py

This dashboard is interactive and flexible:

Users can adjust time windows and deal sizes using sliders
They can select specific securities or counterparties for detailed analysis
The graphs are created using Plotly, which allows for zooming, panning, and hovering for more information

You can further enhance this dashboard by:

Adding more tabs for specific types of analysis
Implementing more complex filtering options
Adding correlation analyses between different variables
Incorporating any specific business logic or KPIs relevant to your trading desk

Would you like me to explain any part of this code in more detail or add any specific features to the dashboard? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJi want the counterparty analysis to be more granular and detailedonce using the filters we fetch certain counterparties which classify as repeated rightfirst show how many are those, what tiers are they mostly from, how many repeated trades are they doing, are they repeating the same bonds as well? something like that, then see if theres some pattern around them repeating, can do hour of the day etc as well. be more creativethen allow to select a certain counter party, i.e allow to enter in a text box or sth , and then in another tab show their stats, their trades, their patternsget me? a proper story should flow and it should be impactful and make total sense please EditAbsolutely, I understand you want a more detailed and storytelling approach to the counterparty analysis.

This enhanced counterparty analysis provides a more comprehensive and storytelling approach:

Overview of Repeated Trading Activity:

Shows the number of counterparties with repeated trades and the total number of repeated trades.
Displays a pie chart of customer tiers for repeated traders.


Repeated Bonds Analysis:

Calculates the average number of different bonds inquired about by repeated traders.


Time Pattern Analysis:

Presents hourly and day-of-week distributions of repeated trades.
Shows the distribution of time intervals between repeated trades.


Individual Counterparty Analysis:

Allows selection of a specific counterparty for detailed analysis.
Provides insights on:

Total repeated trades and customer tier
Bond preference
Trade direction (buy/sell)
Trade size distribution
Hourly trading pattern
Recent trade history





This analysis tells a story by:

Starting with an overview of repeated trading activity across all counterparties.
Drilling down into time-based patterns that might indicate systematic trading behaviors.
Allowing for a deep dive into individual counterparty behavior, which can reveal unique trading patterns or preferences.

To make this even more impactful:

Add a "Key Insights" section at the top that automatically generates bullet points of notable findings (e.g., "5% of counterparties account for 50% of repeated trades").
Implement a feature to compare selected counterparty's behavior against the average.
Add a correlation analysis between repeated trading frequency and other factors like market volatility or specific economic indicators.
Include a predictive element that suggests which counterparties are likely to make repeated trades in the near future based on historical patterns.

This structure allows users to start with a broad overview and then dive deeper into specific areas of interest, creating a logical flow of analysis and storytelling through data. CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJok so first of all give me the full code use liquidity score somewhere as well, ie is the counter party mostly trying to offload bad liquidity maybe? see how the bonds compare also check for pairs trading, maybe some counterparties trade a certain pair of instruments together maybe? BE CREATIVE as much as u can, test for as many things as u can now give me a full code with fully functioning dashboard please helps find hidden gems of information from the data ok check for ladder trading too and all the strategies u mentioned above be as detailed as possible and explore other all strategies that u mentioned above ok EditCertainly!

 CopyRetryClaude’s response was limited as it hit the maximum length allowed at this time. Claude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.FJok the main focus here is that we first need to filter out counter parties which follow the criteria in the sliders first then we focus on those counterparties trades and dig deeper into those detailstry to see if they are trading in a certain way, do u get me? and then dig deeperlike the focus is to see counterparties doing things in a certain way i think EditI understand. You want to focus on identifying and analyzing counterparties that meet specific criteria based on the slider inputs, and then dive deep into their trading patterns. Let's refocus the dashboard to achieve this. Here's a revised version that emphasizes this approach:

# Add any additional analyses or visualizations here
This revised dashboard focuses on:

Filtering counterparties based on user-defined criteria (time difference, number of days, minimum number of trades).
Providing an overview of the qualifying counterparties, including their tier distribution, trade frequency, and average liquidity scores.
Allowing detailed analysis of individual qualifying counterparties, showing their trading patterns, preferred bonds, trade directions, and size distributions.
Analyzing specific trading patterns among the qualifying counterparties, including:

Potential pairs trading
Ladder trading
Liquidity seeking behavior
Time-based trading patterns



This approach allows users to:

Quickly identify counterparties that meet specific trading criteria.
Understand the overall characteristics of these "interesting" counterparties.
Dive deep into individual counterparty behavior.
Identify common trading strategies or patterns among these counterparties.

The dashboard is now more focused on telling a story about the counterparties that meet the specified criteria, allowing for a more targeted analysis of potentially interesting trading behaviors.
To use this dashboard:

Save the script as focused_counterparty_analysis.py
Ensure you have the required libraries installed
Replace 'your_data.csv' with the path to your actual data file
Run the command: streamlit run focused_counterparty_analysis.py

This structure should provide a more targeted analysis of counterparties exhibiting specific behaviors, allowing you to dig deeper into their trading patterns and strategies.
